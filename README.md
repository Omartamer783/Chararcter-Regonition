Model 1 outperforms Model 2 across precision, recall, and F1 score. Model 1 is more balanced in terms of precision and recall, resulting in a higher F1 score. If precision is a crucial factor, Model 1 may be preferred; otherwise, both models exhibit reasonably good performance. Although the two models have good accuracy, it turns out that adding HOG was not very beneficial for enhancing the performance of the model. One of the reasons that some details were not captured by local gradient by HOG
